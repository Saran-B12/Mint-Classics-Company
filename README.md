## ***Analyse Data in a Fictional Mint Classics Company using MySql***

***Project Description:***

   This project aims to analyse data in a relational database with the goal of supporting inventory-related business decisions that lead to the reducing inventory or closure of a storage facility at a fictional Mint Classics Company.
   
***Tools used:***

â€¢	Mysql workbench : Its used to importing data and analysing the data

***Task 1:***
    
  Creating and importing the database in MySql workbench.
    
***Task 2:***

 Task 2 is to understand the mint classics database and understand how the tables are related to one and another using EER diagram(Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram).

***Task 3:***

   Task 3 is to familiarize with the data and start to examine it. I will identify tables that are relevant for this problem and use sql queries to retrieve the necessary data.   
The questions that are to be addressed,

 1. Checking how many warehouses are there and how many stocks are present in them?
 2. Are all warehouses making profits in their total revenue?
 3. Are there products which are low in sales but high in inventory stock?
 4. Are there products which are high in demand but low in inventory stock? How to address in situation? 
 5. Are there any relationship between product prices and their sales level?
 6. Finding who are all the customers who brought overall products?

***Recommendations:***

I have conducted data analysis using Mysql queries and formulated recommendations to address the inventory related business problem.
1. After analysing the data, I have founded that there are some products in the warehouses that are very high in inventory but low in sales and vice versa. My recommendation is to reduce the products which are very high in inventory and to stock more of the products that are less in inventory. Reducing the inventory level can help in lowering the costs.
2. Customer data has helped to identify customers who are buying many things from the company. My recommendation is to focus on them for sales and give them some incentives to increase the sales and reduce inventory products.
